# RandomPasswordGenerator
 
#### In function call ```GenerateContents(x, y, z)``` you can edit the values of x, y, and z to create a stronger password (make it longer). 
#### I wouldn't exactly recommend this for accounts you care about.

#### lowerchars.txt, upperchars.txt, and NumberGen.txt are how the values are stored and get cleared with ```file.truncate(0)``` every time the function is called.
